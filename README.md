# weekly-status-tracker

A tiny weekly status tracker you can run on **GitHub Pages**.

- Each week has two lists of editable tiles:
  - **Last week (done)**
  - **Next week (plan)**
- Everything is stored **locally in your browser** via `localStorage`.
- You can **export/import JSON** to move data between browsers.

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy
This repo is designed to work with GitHub Pages (static).
